
Modified port for the GCW0/RG-350 (OpenDingux) by gameblabla
Trying to get this to run at acceptable speeds was challenging.
Further work could be done on the game (making it render at a low resolution) but it's not worth it i think.


*** Warning ***

It is suggested to lower the sound volume before booting up the game since It can be a bit loud.

Since all of the music I found were all CC0 licensed, I didn't really bothered to credit their orignal creators.
I realized it's a bad idea since people would think I made them when it wasn't in fact made by me (Also these people are awesome they deserve to be credited),
so I decided to went back to find the source of these audio files and credit their original creators.

Since I couldn't find the source of the sound effects I used, there is no way for me to know whether I actually had the right to use them, which is pretty akward.
I decided to handle it by replacing all the sound effects with the ones I actually made. (All of which are from Froggo Swing 'n Grapple)
